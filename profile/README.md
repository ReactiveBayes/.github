# Reactive Bayes 

Open source software for reactive, efficient and scalable Bayesian inference

Welcome to the Reactive Bayes organization! We develop and maintain a suite of Julia packages for probabilistic programming and Bayesian inference with a focus on reactive and message-passing based inference algorithms.

Our key packages include:

- [RxInfer](https://github.com/ReactiveBayes/RxInfer.jl): A high-level probabilistic programming framework that enables reactive Bayesian inference through message passing
- [ReactiveMP](https://github.com/ReactiveBayes/ReactiveMP.jl): A message passing-based inference engine that implements the core algorithms and rules
- [GraphPPL](https://github.com/ReactiveBayes/GraphPPL.jl): A domain-specific language for specifying probabilistic graphical models
- [ExponentialFamily](https://github.com/ReactiveBayes/ExponentialFamily.jl): Comprehensive implementations of exponential family distributions
- [Rocket](https://github.com/ReactiveBayes/Rocket.jl): A reactive programming framework providing core primitives for event handling and streaming for Julia

Our packages are designed to work together seamlessly to provide:

- **Reactive Inference**: Real-time updates as new data arrives
- **Message Passing**: Efficient inference through local computations
- **Scalability**: Handle large models and datasets
- **Flexibility**: Mix and match components for your specific needs

We welcome contributions from the community! Check out our individual package repositories for more details on how to get involved.
